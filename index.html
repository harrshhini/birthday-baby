    <h1>Happy Birthday, Baby! </h1>
    <p>
        Happy birthday. I really wish that I was there with you right now, making sure you feel as special as you are to me. I wanna be the one planning your day, spoiling you, making you feel like the most important person in the world; because you are. But since I can’t be there, at least we’re under the same moon, right? And if not this time, then the next, because I know, without a doubt, that we’re meant for each other.

        I don’t know why, but lately, I feel like I love you even more than before. I mean, I always have, but recently, it’s been so much that I don’t even know what to do with myself. I catch myself thinking about you all the time; about us, about our future, about finally meeting you. And the more I think about it, the more I just know you’re it for me.

        My favorite part of every single day is getting to talk to you. No matter how tired, stressed, or drained I am, hearing your voice, texting you, or even just knowing you’re there makes everything feel okay. I don’t think you realize just how much you mean to me. You’re my safe place, my happiness, my everything.

        I just wanna be with you already. Wanna hold you, wanna kiss you every minute of every day, wanna make up for all the time we’ve spent apart. I wanna give you the kind of love that makes you feel so safe, so wanted, so completely mine that you never have to question a thing.

        I love you, baby. Happy birthday. I hope today is everything you deserve and more, because you deserve the absolute best; always.
    </p>
